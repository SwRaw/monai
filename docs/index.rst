MONAI on ROCm documentation
*****************************

The Medical Open Network for AI (MONAI) is a domain-optimized, open-source framework based on PyTorch, explicitly designed for deep learning in healthcare imaging. MONAI 1.5.0 on ROCm is a HIP port of `MONAI upstream version 1.5.0 <https://monai.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew_1_5.html>`_. It is API-compatible with upstream MONAI without requiring any code changes.

MONAI on ROCm, a ROCm-enabled version of `MONAI <https://project-monai.github.io/>`_, is built on top of `PyTorch for AMD ROCm <https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-for-amd-rocm-platform-now-available-as-python-package/>`_, helping healthcare and life science innovators to leverage GPU acceleration with AMD Instinct™ GPUs for high-performance inference and training of medical AI applications.

MONAI on ROCm offers open, scalable, and high-performance solutions for life science and healthcare workloads.

The MONAI on ROCm key features include:

- Flexible preprocessing for multidimensional medical imaging data.

- Compositional and portable APIs for smooth integration into existing workflows.

- Domain-specific implementations for networks, losses, evaluation metrics, and more.

- Customizable design according to user expertise.

- Multi-GPU multinode data parallelism support.

.. note::

  MONAI 1.5.0 on ROCm is in an early access state. Running production workloads is not recommended.

The code is open and hosted at `<https://github.com/ROCm-LS/monai>`_.
